## Present Value
Given:
- An interest rate $r$
- Over $m$ compounding periods per year

The following are equivalent:
1. Receive $A$ after $k$ compounding period
2. Receive $d_kA$ now

Where $d_k$ denotes the ***discount factor***
$$d_k=\dfrac1{(1+r/m)^k}$$
### Ideal Bank
1. An ***ideal bank***:
- Gives the same interest for both *deposits* and *loans*
- Has no service charge or fees
- Gives the same interest no matter the size of the principal

2. If an ideal bank has an ***interest value*** which does not change over the period of time, it is called a ==***constant ideal bank***==

Ex: In practice a bank might give an interest of $r$ for a 1-year *Certificate Deposit*, but would give a higher interest $q$, where $q>r$ for a 2-year period.

## Cash Streams (Cash Flows)
![[Pasted image 20231019093238.png]]

Given a stream where $x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_n$ are the returns at some period and (for example) a present time step at $x_0$ and future time step at $x_6$

We can find a relation between present value $PV$ and future value $FV$ of the given stream.

$$
\begin{align}
FV&=\sum\limits_{k=0}^nx_k\times(1+r/m)^{n-k} \tag{1. Compounding}
\\\\
PV&=\sum\limits_{k=0}^nx_k\times(1+r/m)^{-k} \tag{2. Discounting}
\end{align}
$$
- Notice that in (1) the power is reversed ($n-k$). This is because each cash value occurs in a given period and then compounding is applied to it until the end period $k$. E.g. the value $x_0$ occurs in time period 0 and gets compounded at all $n$ compounding periods. The value $x_1$ occurs 1 period later and receives interest only $n-1$ times.
- Conversely, in (2) the first 

$2*1.1^3 + 2*1.1^2 + 2*1.1 = 7.282$
