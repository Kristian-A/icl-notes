## Duration of a Portfolio

It is simply an average of the durations of each investment weighted by the price of the investment.
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{P}&=P_1+P_2+P_3+\cdots+P_n\\
\mathbf{D}&=\dfrac{P_1D_1+P_2D_2+P_3D_3+\cdots+P_nD_n}{\mathbf{P}}
\end{align}
$$
## Investment Risks

The two bonds impose 2 types of risks respectively:
1. Reinvestment Risk (***Interest rates go down***) - Reinvest the principal at a lower interest rate, which means the investment will now generate less income than before. This is a concern if  a certain amount of income is needed to match future liabilities.
2. Market Risk (***Bond prices go down***) - This is the risk of bond prices falling due to rising interest rates. If you need to sell a bond before it matures (as you might in this scenario after 1 year if you initially purchase a 5-year bond), you might receive less than the bond's face value if interest rates have risen, because newer issues offer higher yields and make your lower-yielding bond less attractive.

#### Interest rates go up
***PVs of bonds go down***

1. The 1-year bond will mature, and the principal will be reinvested at lower price and a higher yield which means more profit ($\uparrow$)
2. The 5-year bond will go down in price therefore a premature sell will result in less profit $(\downarrow)$

#### Interest rates go down
***PVs of bonds go up*** (both because present values are discounted less and because bonds are more desirable)

1. The 1-year bond will mature, and the principal will be reinvested at a higher price with a lower yield $\downarrow$
2. The 5-year bond will go up in price so selling prematurely results in more profit $\uparrow$

## Immunization

Striking a balance between the two bonds would ensure that fluctuations in the interest would not affect the final price of the portfolio. I.e. the portfolio is ***immunised*** against investment risk.

Construct a portfolio that matches the liability price of 1000 and duration of 2 years

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{P}&=x_1P_1+x_2P_2\\
\mathbf{D}&=\dfrac{x_1P_1D_1}{\mathbf{P}}+\frac{x_2P_2D_2}{\mathbf{P}}
\end{align}
$$
And just solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$

In order to match the liability even better convexity or even more terms can be accounted for.
#### Duration
Notice how the duration is used and not the actual maturities. This is because duration takes into account the time-value of money and creates a more accurate model.
