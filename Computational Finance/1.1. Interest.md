## Principal and Interest
- Principal: amount invested ($W$)
- Interest: rent paid on the principal ($I$)
- Interest rate: interest per unit currency invested ($r$)
$$
I=Wr
$$
Given a yearly interest $r$ the account holdings in a year will be:
$$
\begin{align}
W_0&=W\\
W_1&=W_0+I=W_0+W_0r\\
W_1&=W_0(1+r)
\end{align}
$$

## Compound Interest
Given a varying interest $r_k$, for $k=1,2,\cdots,n$, after $n$ years the account holdings will be

$$
W_n=W\prod\limits_{i=1}^n(1+r_i)
$$
For a fixed interest $r$ the account holdings after $n$ years are:
$$W_n=W(1+r)^n$$

## Compounding at different periods
Usually, interest is quoted in an yearly basis, but in reality it is added on a smaller ***compounding period***.

They year is divided in $m$ compounding periods, and interest needs to be calculated based on them.

Nominal rate: $r$ (yearly)
Length of a compounding period: $\dfrac1m$
Interest rate for each of the compounding period: $\dfrac rm$
Growth of the account over $k$ periods: $(1+r/m)^k$
Growth of the account over 1 year: $(1+r/m)^m$

In reality the effective interest rate $r_{eff}$ is higher than just applying the interest rate once at the end of the year as compounding would take effect $m$ times:
$$r_{eff} = (1+r/m)^m$$

## Continuous Compounding
Increasing the compounding periods to infinity, gives the notion for a continuous compounding.
In fact the limit converges like so:
$$
\lim\limits_{m\rightarrow\infty}(1+r^{1/k})^{m}=e^{r}
$$
Introducing $t$ to denote the number of years of compounding:
$$
\lim\limits_{m\rightarrow\infty}(1+r^{1/k})^{mt}=e^{rt}
$$
