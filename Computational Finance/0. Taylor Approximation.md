Given some arbitrary function $f(x)$ we want to approximate the function around a fixed point $c$

Firstly, the main idea behind it is to try to find a function $g(x)$ which matches the value of $f(x)$. In other words we are looking for a function $g(x)$ where:
$$
g(x)=f(c)
$$
This obviously is a very bad approximation as $g$ matches $f$ only at $c$. In order to improve the approximation, we can make $g(x)$ have a ***first derivative*** which matches the first derivative of $f$, but still preserves the above equality.

To achieve this we can simply add the first derivative of $f$ in the equation:
$$
g(x)=f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)
$$

The term $x-c$ ensures that we preserve the initial property of $g(x)=f(c)$. Concretely, when we evaluate $g(c)$:
$$
g(c)=f(c)+f'(c)(c-c)=f(c)
$$

However, now when we evaluate the first derivative of $g$ we get:
$$
\begin{align*}
g(x)&=f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)\\\\
g'(x)&=\dfrac{f(c)}{dx}+\dfrac{f'(c)(x-c)}{dx}
\\\\&=0+f'(c)=f'(c)
\\\\g'(x)&=f'(c)
\end{align*}
$$

Now we have encapsulated both the actual value and the first derivative around the point c:
$$
\begin{align}
g(x)&=f(c)\\
g'(x)&=f'(c)
\end{align}
$$

==Having more and more derivatives would make a better and better approximation in the small range around the point $c$. ==

Now to ensure that the third derivative of $g$ is the same as the on of $f$ we can do a similar process:
$$
g(x)=f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)+\dfrac12f''(c)(x-c)^2
$$

The $1/2$ factor is added to ensure that when we take the first derivative there is not a $2$ factor in front of the last term:

$$
\begin{align}
g'(x)&=\dfrac{f(c)}{dx}+\dfrac{f'(c)(x-c)}{dx}+\dfrac12\dfrac{f''(c)(x-c)^2}{dx}
\\\\&=0+f'(c)+f''(c)(x-c)
\\&=f'(c)
\end{align}
$$

A general formula for $n$ terms would be:
$$
g_n(x)=f(c) + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}\dfrac{1}{k}\dfrac{d^kf(c)}{d^kx}(x-c)^k
$$
